Important instructions before running this project:

You can ignore the first 6 code cells if you already downloaded the correct dataset into your local repository

Else, follow these instructions:

- Your local repository should contain a `kaggle.json` file which is generated when you create an API in your Kaggle account
  - The `kaggle.json` file will contain your API details (your username and key) (I deleted my `kaggle.json` for security purposes)
- Then, it is important to run the first 6 code cells of the SlashMark_Project_5.ipynb file
  - It is necessary because the first 4 code cells set up your Kaggle account details in your notebook's repository
  - The next 2 code cells (5th and 6th) are essential for downloading and setting up the dataset directly from Kaggle
